During today\'92s Robotics class we focused on engineering. We started off the lesson figuring out what exactly Engineering is, and it was defined as utilizing knowledges from science and math into creation seeking to enhance the living quality of the world. Later, we explored on a specific field of engineering, and our group chose to investigate on Electrical Engineering. This field is definitely a really popular field because basically what they engineer takes part in our everyday life. Additionally, they also change the world by inventing and developing various technological innovation that improves the world significantly. At the end of the lesson, engineering notebook was introduced, its a notebook where the engineer keeps track of his or her own work. }
